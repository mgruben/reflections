How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory contains all files and folders associated with that git repository, however the staging area is a "temporary" collection of the files and folders which are associated with the next logical commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
git add {all,files,which,are,logically,grouped,in,this,commit}
git commit -m "fix or feature or cleanup"
rinse && repeat
